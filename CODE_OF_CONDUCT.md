# Contributor code of conduct

## Purpose

To maintain a sustainable and usable project, the contributors are expected to adhere to a very minimal set of standards and behavior practices. 

## Astonishing expectations

- Be respectful and constructive in all communication.
- Only introduce breaking changes after discussions and it is understood.
- All contributions must be through Pull Requests.
- Be sure to clearly writing your changes in the Pull Request description.
- Your code and documentation changes must respect the structure and standard of the project.

## Contributor workflow

1. Fork the repo (you'll have write access to your repo).
2. Create a new branch for you feature or fix.
3. Make your changes.
4. Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch.
5. Provide a clear and descriptive title and description of your changes.
6. Wait for review and approval.

We **do not accept**:
- Pushes directly into the `main` branch.
- Changes without a review and description.
- Contributions that change the licensing terms.

## Good practices

- Local testing of changes is recommended before your submission.
- Use existing directory and naming conventions.
- Update the documentation when relevant.
- Make atomic commits with a description.
